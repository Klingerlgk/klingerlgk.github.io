  <p>Door Counties weather can be all over the place. From humid and <br/>
  sticky to dry and freezing. But that is because the people of Door County <br/>
  live on a peninsula and the water around the peninsula helps effect the climate <br/>
  around it. So the counties weather can be an interesting topic if it peaks your <br/>
  interest.</p>
